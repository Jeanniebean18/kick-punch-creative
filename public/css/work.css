Hi Amanda!

I know you guys are super dog-friendly, so we wanted to ask if you'd want to be a sponsor for Omaha Furshion Week, Omaha's first Dog Fashion week. 

We're working with Anna Willey of MTC to create the main event that will take place in Turner Park on June 4th. 

Since you are a dog-friendly business, we’d love to have you sponsor at our event in Midtown Crossing.  We think it’s going to be huge - We have Q98 and Midtown Crossing helping us make this event a success. We really want to showcase the dog-friendly businesses of Omaha, so we hope you can attend. All proceeds will go directly back to the community to fund waste stations and aiding in dog-park funding. There’s a couple different ways you can get involved, visit the site here for sponsorship information: http://omahafurshionweek.com/be-a-sponsor/
If you have questions, let me know! We’d love to have you!
